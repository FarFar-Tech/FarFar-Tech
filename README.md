<---
FarFar-Tech is supposed to be a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository for students 
and developers who are interested in learning more about Data Analysis, 
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Remote Sensing.  
--->

- ðŸ‘»ðŸ“Š My articles published in different conferences and journals can be found here: 
  https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gNB1jdYAAAAJ&hl=en

- What I cover in this repo is as follows:

1. **Data analysis and Pre-processing data ->** Importing libraries, importing datasets, handling missing data points, encoding categorical data, splitting datasets into test sets and training sets, feature scaling, and outliers deals. Furthermore, you can find codes about some famous and foundational libraries, such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.
