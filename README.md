- 👋 Hi, I’m @FarFar-Tech
- 👀 I’m interested in long-walk, video games, tech podcast, and gym. 
- 🌱 I’m currently doing my PhD in Information Communication System (ICT). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects focused on remote sensing.

<---
FarFar-Tech is supposed to be a ✨ special ✨ repository for students 
and developers who are interested in learning more about Data Analysis, 
Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Remote Sensing.

- What I cover in this repo is as follows:
1. Data analysis and Pre-processing data: improting libraries, importing datasets, handling missing data points, encoding categorical data, splitting datasets into test set and training set, feature scaling, and outliers deals. Furthemore, you can find codes about some famous and foundational libraries, such as Seaborn, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Numpy.
2. ML algorithms for different tasks (classification and regression) are covered in this repo: Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), K Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), Decision Tree (DT), and clustering-based algorithms (KNN, DBSCAN).
3. DL algorithms: Artifical Neural Network (ANN), Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
4. Computer Vision: image processing and feature extractions by OpenCV library. Tasks like image classification, object detection, image segmentation, image captioning are covered.
